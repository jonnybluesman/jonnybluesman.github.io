            I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Informatics at King's
            College London, and Honorary Researcher at the University of Liverpool.
            Currently, I work on the EU H2020 <a href="https://polifonia-project.eu">Polifonia</a>
            project, where I lead the <a href="https://polifonia-project.eu/pilots/interlink/">INTERLINK</a> pilot.

            My research lies at the intersection of Machine Learning and Music Technology.
            I design methods for computational music analysis and information retrieval:
            from the detection of structures, emotions, and similarities in music, to
            the design of systems for personalised music discovery and recommendation.
            Using a computational lens, I seek to investigate the link between
            music, memory, and emotions, to <span class="thick">derive</span> 
            knowledge that can be <span class="thick">used</span> to improve our
            understanding of music, personalise music listening for wellbeing,
            enhance computational creativity and increase engagement in music education.

            I received a PhD in Machine Learning from the University of
            Manchester, under the supervision of Prof. Angelo Cangelosi
            (<a href="https://www.cs.manchester.ac.uk/research/expertise/machine-learning-and-robotics/">Machine Learning and Robotics</a>), and Dr. Eduardo Coutinho (<a href="https://amlab.liverpool.ac.uk/">Applied Music Research Lab</a>).
            My dissertation, <em>"Structural complexity in music modelling and
            generation with deep neural networks"</em> focused on the open challenge
            of <span class="thick">learning</span> long-term dependencies from sequential data, which, in the music domain, reflects on the models' ability to <span class="thick">generate</span> music with consistent / realistic (long-term) structure. The thesis contributed new methods for structural analysis, modelling, and complexity, that can be used for music processing and for the evaluation of computationally creative systems.

                  <span class="thick">TL;DR:</span> Generated music is not structurally
                  convincing, and we still evaluate this via human experiments. We
                  introduced a method that can automatically evaluate structural
                  complexity: first, we segment music hierarchically (from sections to 
                  phrases, motifs, etc.); then, we "summarise" these segmentations by 
                  describing the decomposition process of music (how music ideas
                  progressively break down into shorter fragments).
                </p>
                <div class="ui divider"></div>
                <p>
                  Wondering why AI-generated music still sounds like elevator music? 
                  Composing musical ideas longer than phrases is still an open 
                  challenge in computer-generated music, a problem that is commonly
                  referred to as the lack of long-term structure in the generations.
                  In addition, the evaluation of the structural complexity of
                  artificial compositions is still done manually - requiring 
                  expert knowledge, time and involving subjectivity which is
                  inherent in the perception of musical structure.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To evaluate structural complexity from arbitrary music pieces,
                  a novel algorithm for music structure analysis and a set of
                  metrics were designed. The former is used to segment music
                  hierarchically by detecting nested structural segments at all
                  possible temporal levels. This is followed by the extraction
                  of a set metrics to formally describe the decomposition process
                  of music into its structural components. 
                </p>

                  Once computed on a dataset including random, real and
                  computer-generated music (groups which we expect to be associated
                  with different degrees of structural complexity) these metrics
                  allow to discriminate between these groups. We also showed how
                  these metrics, together with their statistical analysis on the
                  dataset, can provide a compact framework for automatically
                  evaluating the structural complexity of a given collection
                  of music or individual tracks.

                <p> Estimating the effects of introducing a range of smart
                mobility solutions within an urban area is a crucial concern in
                urban planning. Local public authorities and mobility service
                providers currently base their mobility decisions on common
                heuristics and best practices. However, these approaches
                struggle to generalize any urban context, thus it follows that
                their effectiveness and applicability are often compromised.
                In particular, these approaches might end up being risky for
                decision makers, since the resulting mobility initiatives may be
                unaccepted by the population and this would translate in a
                considerable waste of resources.</p>

                <p>
                Tangramob is an agent-based simulation framework that allows
                users to assess the impacts, in terms of people adoption and
                system performance, of the introduction of new smart mobility
                services within an urban area of interest. Starting from the
                urban road network of the geographical area under study, a
                sample population and a smart mobility initiative (a list of
                mobility services together with their definition), Tangramob
                simulates how urban traffic is expected to evolve as citizens
                start experiencing the newly offered traveling solutions.

                <p>
                Tangramob relies on an Agent-Based Model (ABM) in which every
                person in the sample population is modeled as an autonomous
                reasoning agent. During the simulation, each agent will try to
                understand how to better move within the city in order to satisfy
                its daily mobility needs in the best way. To do this, agents
                are given the ability to use all the mobility services available
                to perform their travels, and to record their traveling experience
                in a personal (and persistent) data structure (a Knowledge Base).

                Following a Reinforcement Learning (RL) strategy, a Tangramob
                simulation is organized as a series of iterations, so that a
                single day is simulated multiple times: this approach
                allows citizens to accumulate experience so as to come up with
                better mobility decisions. At the end of a simulation, we will
                be able to understand how the mobility initiative is accepted by
                the population and how it affects both citizens and urban system.

                <p>
                This open-source computational tool can thus be thought of as a
                Decision Support System (DSS) for Smart Mobility, since it is
                meant to support urban planner and transport companies in
                understanding if the simulated results of a mobility initiative
                are expected to be in line with their objectives and plans.

                The peculiarities of this tool are: the adaptability to different
                geographical contexts; the support of multimodal trips and
                mobility services; the ability to reproduce real-life scenarios.
                Technically speaking, Tangramob is developed on
                <a href="http://www.matsim.org/">MATSim</a>, an open-source
                framework to implement large-scale agent-based transport
                simulations.

                <p>In Social Network Analysis (SNA), the field of information
                diffusion has recently gained interest since it aims to
                understand how people react to new incoming information within
                an influential environment. Predicting how a piece of news can
                spread over a social network is quite challenging since it
                depends on many factors like its content, the users elected to
                start its spread, the topology of the network, the interest
                rates of the exposed users along with their social network
                behavior as well. However, most traditional models of diffusion
                are mainly concerned with the social network topology when
                identifying the causes of word of mouth, thereby disregarding
                that users behave differently during their social network
                experience; e.g. a person who is continuously sharing posts on
                his wall has a greater spreading effect than a reserved user.</p>

                <p>jSeagull, a Java Simulation Engine for Agent-Graph
                Understanding in Local Lattices, is a new simulation model for
                information diffusion based on users' social network behaviors
                for both news exposure and sharing attitude. Given a piece of
                news (e.g. a post or a tweet) and a social network, the
                phenomenon of <em>word of mouth</em> is modeled in terms of an
                <em>epidemiology problem</em> as follows: susceptible agents are
                impersonated by social network users whereas a piece of news to
                be spread within the social network plays the role of the
                epidemics. More precisely, a user is considered infected if
                he/she believes on the piece of news once he/she receives it.

                Being able to predict such spread is not an easy task since we
                are dealing with humans characters, but an acceptable accuracy
                can be reached if user personal data are available.</p>

                  <img src="assets/imgs/projects/jSeagull/net1.png">
                  <img src="assets/imgs/projects/jSeagull/net2.png">
                  <img src="assets/imgs/projects/jSeagull/net3.png">
                </div>

                <p> On a technical viewpoint, jSeagull requires a social network
                (a directed graph where nodes represent users and edges denote
                their friendship or follow relationship) and a file describing
                the personal data and the interests of each user. Examples of
                these files used in jSeagull can be found on the
                <a href="http://snap.stanford.edu/">SNAP website</a>.
                Next, the tool will guide you through the procedure of
                <em>news/post design</em>, in order to create the specific
                content for which we want to measure its spread within the
                social network under study.  During this procedure, it is
                possible to write some text, add hashtags and tag some social
                network users, like in common social networks.
                Once the post is created, jSeagull applies a coloring scheme to
                the nodes of the social network graph in such a way to emphasize
                the interest rates of the users for that piece of news. This
                allows the observer to iterate through the post creation step
                until he/she finds an impactful piece of news.

                Finally, the observer has just to select a set of initial
                spreaders, i.e. those social network users who are expected to
                initiate and trigger the spread of the previously designed piece
                of news. The simulation is then ready to start: during this
                process is quite compelling to observe how the "epidemics"
                propagates among users as they get in touch with the piece of
                news. Unlike other existent approaches, it is worth remarking
                that the actual news spread of the piece of news depends on
                users' interests and sharing behaviors, as well as
                the affinity and strength of their friendship ties.</p>

              <div class="description">
                <p>The availability of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools
                  and resources, together with the integration of some artificial
                  intelligence techniques, allowed the advancement of traditional
                  Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) systems.
                  The formula AI + CALL has brought to Intelligent CALL (ICALL),
                  an emergent field aiming at developing learning platforms
                  capable of analyzing language automatically, providing learners
                  with individualized feedback on their mistakes.

                  However, the state of the art of ICALL systems does not include
                  any functional application for the Italian language.</p>

                <p>To fill this gap, we developed ICALL-IT, a new intelligent
                computer-assisted language learning platform for the Italian
                language. The goal of this project is to help young Italian
                students and non-native Italian speakers improve their
                grammatical skills as well as the understanding of the language.

                For this purpose, the first version of ICALL-it provides five
                different exercises (plus variants) based on what is considered
                to be more difficult for an intermediate Italian student.
                Each exercise aims to improve a specific set of the user's
                skills and it comes with one or more learning outcomes.</p>

                  <img src="assets/imgs/projects/icallit/ex5.png">
                </div>

                <p>At the moment, ICALL-IT makes use of the following three NLP
                  resources and tools for enabling the 5 exercises:
                  <a href="http://www.di.unito.it/~tutreeb/">TUT</a> as annotated
                  corpus, <a href="http://sslmitdev-online.sslmit.unibo.it/linguistics/morph-it.php">Morph-it!</a>
                  as lexicon and <a href="http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/">TreeTagger</a>
                  as part-of-speech text tagger.

                  The first one consists in a native representation format which
                  captures the richness of the predicate-argument structure, i.e.
                  a crucial layer of representation for several NLP tasks such as
                  parsing information extraction, machine translation and
                  question answering.

                  The second resource is Morph-it!, a lexicon of inflected forms
                  with their lemma and morphological features. It can be used as
                  a data source for either a lemmatizer, a morphological analyzer
                  or a morphological generator.

                  The last NLP tool used in ICALL-IT is TreeTagger, a
                  language-independent tool for annotating text with part-of-speech
                  and lemma information. TreTagger suggests a new probabilistic
                  tagging method based on decision trees, avoiding problems that
                  Markov Model taggers face when they have to estimate transition
                  probabilities from sparse data.
